# Unsupervised-Deep-Unfolded-PGD-for-Transmit-Power-Allocation-in-Wireless-Systems

Transmit power control (TPC) is a key mechanism for managing interference, energy utilization, and connectivity in wireless systems. In this paper, we propose a simple low- complexity TPC algorithm based on the deep unfolding of the iterative projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm into layers of a deep neural network and learning the step-size parameters. An unsupervised learning method with either online learning or offline pretraining is applied for optimizing the weights of the DNN. Performance evaluation in dense device-to-device (D2D) communication scenarios showed that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the iterative algorithm with more than a factor of 2 lower number of iterations. 

The repository contains codes implementing Deep unfolded projected gradient descent (DUPGD) for TPC and can be used to reproduced the results in [1].
